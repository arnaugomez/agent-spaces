## Open Decisions (My decisions from the presented choices)

### 1. Sandbox Strategy for MVP

Start with Docker from day one

### 2. Monorepo vs Multi-repo

Monorepo with Turborepo for easier development in early stages.

### 3. Configuration Format

TypeScript configuration files with JSON schema for non-TS users.


4. Database

Use SQLite for development for now. Consider PostgreSQL in later stages.
