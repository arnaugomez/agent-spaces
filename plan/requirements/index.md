## Plan

This folder contains product requirements documents for **Agent Spaces** and its **code execution protocol**.

- [Protocol PRD](./protocol-prd.md): PRD for the standard **operations/events protocol** that agents follow.
- [Framework PRD](./framework-prd.md): PRD for the **Agent Spaces** framework (API/SDK/service) that runs code in isolated environments and supports the protocol.

For design documents, see the [design folder](../design/index.md).
